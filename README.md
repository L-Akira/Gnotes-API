## 🔎 About <a name = "about"></a>

Gnotes tries to inovate, bringing a taking note web service on cloud and local as it is possible to run on browsers and mobile application. It also focus on the privacy of the user and giving the total control over their account and showing them all the informations we store and the assurance that once their accont is deleted all the notes and info disapear from the database forever.

## 👨‍🏫 How it works <a name = "how_it_works"></a>

<strong>Note:</strong> For the time being it is under development;

### 📌 Account creation
The user will be able to create an account using their:

- email;
- username;
- password;


### 💾 The method for saving notes
If you are a user of Linux and/or Windows, you probably dealt with partitions, and this idea was brought up to Gnotes and it is very simple.

For those who never dealt with it, think of it as a folder that you receive at the exact time you create an account, inside this folder you can store other forlder and text files. 

### 🔒 Privacy
Gnotes is not meant to store sensitive data of the users, but rather to store notes for the owner of that note until they decide to completely delete it.
Once the user decides to finish their account all notes goes with it and no trace is left.

### 🔧 Techinical information
For the time being the API won't have micreservices for accont management, i.e new password and delete it, and authentication integrated by a messager broker, which means it's all centralized at this API.

### 🤔 Why don't implement all this?
The answer is simple: lack of budget and people for the time being to maintain all this infrastructure.
